# Mobile Flashcards Project
Based on the requirements of Udacity's React/React Native Fundamentals course. Bootstrapped via Create React Native App, it allows users create and manage decks of questions. The user can then quiz themselves based on the cards in each deck. Once the user completes the quiz, there will be a grade displayed for how the user performed. This app leverages React Native and AsyncStorage as the storage component.
